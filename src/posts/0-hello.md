ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, welcome to nathaniscool.com.

My name is Nathan. I'm a software developer in Atlanta. Some things I like in that world (and will probably appear here) are React, TypeScript, build tools, and random tooling things. Off the court I like reading, custom mechanical keyboards, and cooking. So maybe expect stuff about those things.

I built this site using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>, which feels very intuitive and straightforward.

Also it feels nice to actually write purely HTML and CSS again!
